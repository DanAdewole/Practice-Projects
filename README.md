# Practice-Projects
This repository contains submodules for personal projects I have worked on. These projects are small, self-contained projects that I have worked on for fun and learning purposes. Each submodule represents a separate project and includes its own README file with project-specific documentation.

## Projects
### Drum Kits
Description:A website for a drum kit where you can click on a few specific drum parts to hear the sound that goes with that drum part. When you press the button with the correct letter associated with the drum part, the drum parts are also engaged. 
The active drum part will also be displayed in a lovely animation on the screen.

### Musical Time Machine
A software that gathers information from the Bilboard website for the top 100 songs of a particular year of your choosing, feeds it into the Spotify API (here, spotipy will be used instead), and then uses that information to generate a playlist on Spotify.

### Top Movie Listings
A Flask application that lists top 10 movies of one's choice and the information about them.
